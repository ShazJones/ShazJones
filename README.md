- 👋 Hi, I’m @ShazJones
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and in particular all the things that have changed since I first learned in the nineties.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning via CS50 at Harvard with David J Malan - and loving it!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where young people can teach me the newer methods and I can share my experience too.
- 📫 How to reach me - email MissShazJones@gmail.com
